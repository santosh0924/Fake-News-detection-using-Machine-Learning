# Fake News detection using Machine Learning

## Project Summary
‘Fake News’ term is used for intentional misrepresentation of news. They are false stories that are communicated through print, television, and social media. Fake news can be easily spread, and it can be on different topics targeting person or institution. The motive to spread fake news is to mislead the readers and harm reputation of person or organization. Some people or organizations use fake news to project themselves and gain from that sensational news. Analysis on fake news show that although complete fake news is not effective, small portion of them is much effective. They are increasingly prominent and draw more attention than actual facts. Fake news spread very rapidly in social media and reaches all over the world.   

The project proposal to detect the fake news so that people do not believe it and share with others. As part of this project, the ‘Fake News’ dataset will be analyzed to predict if the news is reliable or Fake (Unreliable). Preprocessing will be done to clean the data and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques will be used to convert the text data which can be used for machine learning models. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will be performed for data visualization. Dataset will be split into train and test data. Machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest will be applied, and performance will be evaluated. The model with best score will be selected and tuned to improve performance.
